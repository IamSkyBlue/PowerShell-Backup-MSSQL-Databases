# Backup-MSSQL-Databases.ps1
# Version 1.4
# Last updated Jul-15-2019
#
# This PowerShell script will perform a full backup of all defined MSSQL databases to a BAK file.
# Use Task Scheduler to have this script run daily. The account you run this under will require the proper permission to perform backups in SQL server.
#
# Retention policy: 
# Backups are performed daily, monthly and yearly and are kept in their respective folders under $TopLevelBackupPath. 
# Daily backups will be kept for 30 days. Monthly backups will be kept for 1 year. Yearly backups will be kept for 10 years.
#
# IMPORTANT: Parts that will need be modified for your environment are double commented (##). The rest can safely be left alone.
